# Decision_Trees

Tutorials and Functions which contain relevant information on Decision Trees. The tutorials go through the Iris dataset and the moons dataset. 

The Iris dataset tutorial explains and gives watch-its on how to use and apply Decision Trees with GridSearch. 

The moons datatset tutorial shows how to search for the right parameters for a DecisionTreeClassifier. Using the best parameters obtained we can use this on smaller batches. The tutorial then shows how to make a RandomForestClassifier without actually using the class in Sk-Learn - great way to understand what is going on under the hood!
